# ViewChain

A decentralized platform for content creators to verify, track, and monetize their digital content with blockchain-powered view verification.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Content creators face significant challenges in today's digital landscape:

- Lack of verifiable proof for content viewership metrics
- Difficulty monetizing content beyond traditional platforms
- Limited ownership and control over their digital assets
- Insufficient transparency in audience engagement analytics
- Vulnerability to fraud and view manipulation
